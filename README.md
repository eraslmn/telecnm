# Real-Time Video Chat Application

This repository hosts a comprehensive real-time video chat application developed using React. The application facilitates peer-to-peer communication and integrates several modern technologies such as Redux, Socket.IO & more.

## Project Overview

The real-time video chat application provides a seamless video communication experience between users. Utilizing WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections, Redux for state management, and Socket.IO for real-time signaling, this project is designed to offer robust functionality and a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Live Video Chat:** Enables users to engage in real-time video conversations.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication:** Direct connection between users using WebRTC technology.
- **State Management:** Efficient handling of application state with Redux.
- **Real-Time Signaling:** Instant updates and signaling managed by Socket.IO.

## Technologies Utilized

- **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Redux:** A state management library that ensures predictable state updates.
- **Socket.IO:** A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
- **WebRTC:** A technology that supports real-time peer-to-peer audio, video & data sharing.
- **JavaScript:** The programming language used for both front-end and back-end development.
- **HTML & CSS:** Markup and styling languages used to create the structure and design of the web application.
